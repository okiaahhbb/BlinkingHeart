## Overview
<p
This project explores a simple LED heartbeat animation designed as a creative electronics exercise.

It was developed ahead of Valentine’s Day as a small personal build, combining free time with an interest in creating something visually expressive. The same concept was implemented using two different approaches: a hardware-based version using a 555 timer, and a programmable version using an Arduino to allow finer control over timing and animation behavior.

The project serves as a comparison of analog and digital design methods while maintaining a clean, minimal visual aesthetic.
